    <h1>I'm just here for a bag</h1>
    <p>
        I get it. You probably saw on TikTok or YouTube that you could run up a bag learning the coding shit....You can.  It's not impossible to make 6 figs making the next Facebook...oop my b "Meta", or the next Snapchat, WhatsApp, TikTok, Tinder, YouTube..man you get it.  Ever since the internet was created it's been about convenience.  Hell we got VR AND AR now.  The internet, computers and Tech aint going nowhere nor is it slowing down for anybody.  At this point technology took the Beans approach "You either get down..or LAY DOWN".

        The bag is bottomless here in Programming.  Companies will pay good, and I do mean GOOD, money for those who know their way around a text editor or an IDE, Integrated Development Environment.  Depending on a few things
        <ul>
            <li>Where you live</li>
            <li>What specialty field you decide to learn</li>
            <li>your "level of experience"</li>

        </ul>
        Maruchan will be an option (stay humble) no longer a necessity.

        My advice, based on my personal experience, always practice.  I'm a self-taught SE and the it look me a good 2 years to learn what I have.  I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, Ruby, C(+,#) and React.  I'm currently learning Cloud based programming and once I'm done with that I will be learning AR(Augmented Reality) and VR(Virtual Reality).  All of these languages are only making me more valuable as an Engineer which will allow me to ask for more money during negotiations #knowyourworth. The more you know the more of a asset you become.  If you work for a company or if you are working for yourself you know what you are bringing and what its worth.  What other line of work will negotiate with you on how much they will pay you? Don't worry I'll wait.
