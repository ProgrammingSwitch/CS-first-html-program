    <h1>You're and Engineer Harry.</h1>

        Hot take.  Once you have learned ONE programming language....you are a software engineer.  Come at me coders.  In this lifestyle, Yes I say lifestyle, you will run into a lot of gatekeepers and elitist who will say "You didn't got to a college, oh then you're not a REAL engineer", or "Oh you don't know what 'insert obscure coding langage' is?" and my personal favorite "Im a Software Developer/Engineer NOT a coder!".....it's giving "I'm not black, I'm O.J"...ok.  You can call yourself whatever you like, they all mean and do the same thing.  Those of us who work in this business like to say we are developers of engineers.  While your Granny cousin's boyfriends neice might call you a programmer or coder.  They are interchangable.  All these titles mean that you use a certain language to make a program do something.  Now a Software Engineer is NOT the same as a Computer Engineer.  To keep it simple, a SE talks to computers, a CE talks to AND build computers.  A Computer Engineer is someone who not ONLY uses programming but also ELECTRICAL Engineering.  So they also deal with shit like resistors, computer chips, motherboards, housing units all that fun stuff.

        We go by many names Engineer, coder, programmer, nerd.  It doesn't really matter as long as you make money.  What IS important is which specialty you decide to go into.  As a reference,  If you become a doctor you get to decide what kind of Doctor you want to become.  You could become and ER doctor, a Surgeon, go into Pediactrics, OBGYN,  Pediatrist all these options.  It's the same for Software Engineering.  You can choose to do.

        People outside of tech tend to see tech as "The Next New/Big Thing".  They think that developers are sitting at computer creating the next Amazon, or the thing that's going to take down Netflix.  This isn't not the case.  Most of the time us programmers are just doing maintanence.  We're maintaining or updating what's already there.  Don't get me wrong we do get to create the next big thing too, but 75% of the time we're working and reworking what is already in place.  Its all great practice, which is the fun part.  You do need to get some kind of enjoyment from it.  The paycheck part is lovely but it shouldn't be the only reason that you're in this trade.  To give you an idea most people that start coding do it because they like to create, others do it because they want to make the next iOS, or to be the next Elon or Jeff.  Whatever the reason it's not JUST to make a 6 fig check.
