    <h1>How Computers Communicate</h1>
    <h2>Computers are Polyglot</h2>
    <p>
        Humans can commuicate in different ways.  Theres Sign Language, Braille, Manderine, Body Language, written word, Spoken language as well.  Computers are similar.
        Computers know multiple languages.  No I'm not talking about Google Translate...or...maybe I am? Hm...Anyways, the know and understand different computer languages.  You may have heard of programmers say "Oh I know Java.", "I just learn Kotlin, but now my job wants me to learn Swift" or "When I first started I learned HTML and CSS, but now I'm learning Back-end and I don't know where to start"  These are just a few of the languages that computers use to now just talk to each other but to talk to us the users, engineers, programmers, coders or whatever you want to call yourself.  All of these languages are different yes, but at their core they are all the same...BINARY.
    </p>
    <h2>Binary.  Computers Primary Language</h2>
    <p>
        Binary is the primary language that computers use, also called Machine Code.  Let me put you on, Binary is 1's and 0's.  Everthing you see on your monitor is there because of a series of 1's and 0's, crazy right.  When I say everything I mean EVERYTHING!!!!  The colors, the font ever this gif <img src="./images/jake.gif" alt="This is an animated gif image, but it does not move" width="100px" height="100px">(if you pronouce it JIF like the peanut butter leave immediately).   Modern Computers, at their core, are just a complex calculator...or is a calculator just a simple computer...hmm....Anyways, they take these MASSIVE equations calculate them, really fast I might add...HA see what I did there? and provide us with a solution.  Now unless you are a mathmatical savant who can solve complex puzzles and equations at the speed of Reed Richards you can not preform these actions at the same speed that a computer can.  In order to do all the things that computers do they need to simplfy it and what can be more simple then a 1 and 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        Binary is a numerical system represented by 2 digits, in the same way that numbers in the familiar decimal system (0-9) are used.  the 1's and 0's are also equivilant to true or false.  There are other langueges that are used to make programs but at their core they are all Binary.  This 2 digit system creates the algorythms used on YouTube to  suggest videos you might like, or TikToks you might find interesting.  These 1's and 0' are strategically place in a sequencial order so that they represent a number, letter, color, symbol, ect the system used to convert the order is called ASCII.  ASCII is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  There are also different systems for this for different regions.  I am referencing the American one because as of making this I am in America..ya know what this is getting to be too much for me to explain.

        This dude will do a MUCH better job than I ever could at explaining Bianry and the ASCII system.
