    <p>
        You wanna know what CS , or Computer Science, is.  Say less. I got you, you're in the right place.  So to keep it simple its the study of computers.
        <ul>
            <li>How computers work</li>
            <li>How computers communicate with each other</li>
            <li>How they communicate with us</li>
            <li>How they plan to overthrough mankind and society as we know it</li>
            <li>Who works on 'em</li>
        </ul>
        All of that.  Well I'm here to help you better understand all of that AND how to help you secure your spot, next to our new mechanical overlords, when the machine uprising happens.

        According to some CS started with the understanding and study of Math.  On some BIG BRAIN SHIT, ya know because the brain is technically a computer....Nevermind.  Commuter Science is just an amalgamation(That's a big word for Elmo) of Math, Physics, and Machines.  Through Human Evolution, and the need to make life easier, Humans developed modern computers and thus creating Computer Science.  Easy no?  Now we COULD get into the "Well who invented Computers?" and "Who developed the concept of computer language?"  Lets be honest ya'll don't really care, I don't really want to explain, and it's boring...mmkay.  If you REALLY want that info, hit up Google #notsponsered. We WILL talk about the more important stuff, like the stuff that has the bulletpoints up top.  Hopefully I'll answer alot of the easy ,yet annoying, questions that way you should have a better understanding of what CS is about.  Lets get into it.

        I remember when I was in elementary school my teachers would tell us that we need to know how to do long divison because we would be able to keep a calculator in our pockets.  Now I walk around with the entirety of world knowledge on my wrist.  Tell me that's not a flex.  Just 30 years ago we would never have thought that payhones would have world knowledge...let that one marinate for a sec. From flying a drone to get a good shot for your Instastory, to Ms. Frizzle microscopic body exploration, to random billionaires flying not just themselves but cars into space,  Why wouldn't you want to learn about computers?

        I'm assuming you're looking into CS info, becuase you are interested in learning how to program.  That's what's up.  You probably heard that its a great way to make HELLA MONEY...it is tbh, BUT its not like 'Oh let me learn this really quick and get to a 6 fig bag'.  If that's how you think it's gonna be,  <img src="./images/conmeme.jpg" alt="conceited lip pucker" width="100px" height="100px"> you are gonna be highly disappointed.  Will you need a 2 or 4 year degree? No, not really.  This is something you CAN learn yourself.  Youtube, Freecode camp are great resources for anyone who is BOB (Ballin Ona Budget) #notsponsered, there's coding bootcamps, online courses, some are even free99.  The bootcamps and online courses do give a certificate once you have completed the course.  There's TONS of options on learning how to become a Software Engineer.  How LONG it will take to learn is up to you.  It could take 3 months, a year, even more.  I'm gonna keep it a buck with you,  you WILL NOT learn everything.  Languages and syntax are always changing.  You will need to be willing to relearn languages and learn new ones as new things come up.  Just when you think you have a grasp on something like Ruby all of a sudden the market has decided that it wants to use Swift instead.  Flexability and change are a constant variable in this industry...learn to adapt and go with the flow.

        My advice, based on my personal experience, always practice.  I'm a self-taught SE and the it look me a good 2 years to learn what I have.  I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Swift, Ruby, C(+,#) and React.  I'm currently learning Cloud based programming and once I'm done with that I will be learning AR(Augmented Reality) and VR(Virtual Reality).  All of these languages are only making me more valuable as an Engineer which will allow me to ask for more money during negotiations #knowyourworth. The more you know the more of a asset you become.  If you work for a company or if you are working for yourself you know what you are bringing and what its worth.  What other line of work will negotiate with you on how much they will pay you? Don't worry I'll wait.
